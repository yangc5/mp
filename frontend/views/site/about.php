    <p>Meeting Planner is a new app designed to make scheduling as simple as it should be. However, Meeting Planner will be developed as part of a <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com">Tuts+ Code tutorial series</a> by <a href="http://tutsplus.com/authors/jeff-reifman">author Jeff Reifman</a>. Every piece of Meeting Planner will be built out in the open as the series progresses. The application is being developed in the <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/programming-with-yii2-getting-started--cms-22440">Yii2 Framework</a> for PHP.</p>
